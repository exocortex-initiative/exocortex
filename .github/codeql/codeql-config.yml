# CodeQL Configuration for Exocortex
# This configuration excludes false positives for SPARQL 1.1 specification-mandated functions.
#
# The SPARQL 1.1 specification (https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/) requires implementations
# to support MD5 and SHA1 hash functions for data hashing purposes:
# - MD5: https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-md5
# - SHA1: https://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-query/#func-sha1
#
# These functions are used for data checksums and content identification,
# NOT for security purposes (passwords, encryption keys, etc.).
