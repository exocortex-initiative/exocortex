      # - main.js: Bundled file with minified third-party code (reflect-metadata, etc.)
      #   Alerts from main.js are filtered because the bundled output includes polyfills
      #   and minified library code where patterns like unreachable statements, hoisted
      #   var declarations, trivial conditionals, and unneeded defensive code are valid
      #   optimization artifacts from esbuild's CommonJS/ESM interop helpers
      # Filter out known false positives before uploading.
      # Test files: TypeScript decorators (@inject) are stripped in compiled JS,
      # making constructor calls appear to have "superfluous" arguments when
      # tests pass mock dependencies directly - this is valid DI testing pattern.
